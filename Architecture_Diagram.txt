```

- Mobile app uses BLE/QR for proximity, stores offline data in SQLite
- Communicates with Google API Gateway, which triggers Google Cloud Functions
- Cloud Functions handle business logic, interact with Cloud SQL/Firestore and GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for OTP and push notifications
- All flows JWT-protected except OTP requests
