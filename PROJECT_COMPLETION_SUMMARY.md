GET /api/wallet/balance       # Get current wallet balance
```

### Transactions
```bash
GET /api/transactions/history # Get transaction history
POST /api/transactions/send   # Send money to recipient
```

### BLE Device Management
```bash
GET /api/ble/devices         # Discover nearby payment terminals
POST /api/ble/pair           # Pair with payment terminal
```

### System Health

## 🛠️ Development Environment

### iOS Build Setup
```bash
# Dependencies verified working:
- Xcode 15.0+
- CocoaPods 1.15.2
- React Native 0.74.1
- Node.js v24.4.1
- iOS Simulator (iPhone 16 Pro)
```

### Key Configuration Files
- `package.json`: All dependencies properly configured
- `Podfile`: iOS dependencies (59 pods successfully installed)
- `AppDelegate.swift`: Simplified RCTBridge implementation
- `metro.config.js`: Metro bundler configuration
- `babel.config.js`: Babel transforms

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters phone number
2. Backend sends OTP via SMS (mocked)
3. User enters 6-digit OTP
4. Backend verifies and returns JWT token
5. All API calls use Bearer token authentication

### Security Measures
- JWT secret: `0d87884270dc6db52f58454d0cd84e4d`
- Phone number validation
- OTP format validation (6 digits)
- Token expiration (24 hours)
- CORS protection
- Helmet security headers

---

## 🧪 Testing Framework

### Automated Integration Tests
- **File**: `test-app-integration.js`
- **Coverage**: All API endpoints
- **Authentication**: Full OTP flow testing
- **Error Handling**: Invalid token scenarios
- **Mock Data**: Realistic transaction/BLE data

### Manual Testing Guide
1. **Start iOS Simulator**: `npx react-native run-ios`
2. **Test Phone Entry**: Use `+1234567890`
3. **Test OTP**: Use any 6-digit code (e.g., `123456`)
4. **Test Navigation**: Verify all screen transitions
5. **Test BLE**: Check device discovery
6. **Test Wallet**: Verify balance display
