# üõ°Ô∏è MicroShield Payments ‚Äî Project Specification

## üìå Overview
MicroShield Payments is a secure, offline-capable mobile payment system. It‚Äôs designed to support low-connectivity zones using Bluetooth proximity, OTP-based verification, and JWT-backed sessions‚Äîwith a front-end built in React Native, proximity handled via Android BLE, and backend services hosted on AWS.

## üß± System Architecture
| Layer            | Technology                        | Purpose                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | React Native                      | UI for wallet, QR scanning, confirmations |
| Backend          | AWS Lambda (Node.js) + API Gateway| Stateless payment processing & sync logic |
| Local Storage    | SQLite (mobile)                   | Offline transaction caching               |
| Cloud Database   | Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)           | Wallet, transaction history, user metadata|
| Authentication   | JWT + OTP via GCM (Firebase)          | Session control, payment authorization    |
| Bluetooth        | Android BLE (Java/Kotlin)         | Merchant/user discovery                   |
| Hosting          | AWS S3, AWS Lambda                | Scalable, low-cost deployment             |

## üîê Core Features
- OTP verification for every transaction
- JWT session token management
- Bluetooth-based merchant/user presence detection
- Offline transaction sync queue
- AES-256 encrypted local log storage
- UI confirmation animations + trust-feedback visuals

## üîÑ Transaction Flow (Live Mode)
1. User scans merchant QR or pairs via BLE
2. Inputs payment amount
3. OTP is sent and verified via GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
4. JWT session token is issued
5. Transaction is processed via AWS Lambda API
6. PostgreSQL database is updated
7. UI renders success animation + push notification sent

## üíæ Offline Transaction Flow
1. Device detects proximity via BLE (merchant presence)
2. Transaction stored locally in SQLite with status PendingSync
3. OTP skipped or performed via SMS (if GSM available)
4. When reconnected: App triggers sync service ‚Üí sends logs to cloud
5. Server verifies and stores transaction
6. Entry marked as Synced

## üì∂ Android BLE Integration
- BLE Permissions in manifest
- BLE Scanning using BluetoothLeScanner
- GATT connection for optional data exchange
- Signal strength used for proximity thresholds

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Deployment Notes
- AWS Lambda handles secure stateless transactions
- AWS API Gateway routes requests from mobile frontend
- PostgreSQL on RDS stores wallet and logs
- GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) used for OTP delivery and push notifications
- AWS S3 hosts static React frontend if needed for web access

## üé® UX Elements
- Success vault-lock animation after payment
- Transaction badge with ‚ÄúTrust Score‚Äù or vibe icon
- Visual countdown timer for OTP entry
- QR codes generated with avatars or merchant logos

## üìà Optimization & Cost Control
- Serverless backend stays within AWS free tier
- BLE reduces dependency on data for proximity transactions
- SQLite caching minimizes real-time DB use
- JWT tokens reduce session management cost

## üîó Integration Possibilities
- Add Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal via backend microservices
- Layer on invoice module or loyalty features
- Extend wallet to support pooled payments or tips

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks & Mitigation Strategies

## Technical & Infrastructure Challenges
- Offline sync complexity: Use event-based sync, UUID+hash, conflict resolution
- BLE instability: Device checks, tune RSSI, QR fallback
- Local storage risks: AES encryption, auto-expiry, remote wipe

## User Experience Concerns
- OTP fatigue: Group micro-payments, trusted contacts, biometrics
- Bluetooth confusion: Onboarding animations, smart prompts, manual fallback
- Offline cap: User-set caps, trust scores, alerts

## Market & Adoption Hurdles
- Merchant BLE onboarding: Plug-and-play dongles, companion app, POS partnerships
- Overlap with existing systems: Highlight offline/BLE, integrate with wallets
- Regulatory compliance: Monitor and adapt to local laws

## Developer Complexity
- Stack diversity: Modularize, CI/CD, internal docs
- Debugging sync: Log tracing, manual retry, admin dashboard
